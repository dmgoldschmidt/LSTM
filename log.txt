Testing LSTMcell via test_LSTM.  I have one cell, and I'm getting "reasonable looking" output
with 2 time steps.  Next test:  generate 100 data points with random parameters, then perturb
the parameters and try to climb back.

Changed Gate.operator() to accept a RowVector<ColVector<double>> instead of three ColVectors {v,s,x}, and added dg_dW for the local parameter update.
